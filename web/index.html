    PHP Google API Test <br><br>

    <a href="/login.php"> Log in with Gmail</a>

    This was how an NGO was going to deal with user passwords and restricted manuals on a WordPress site
    that had public and private user sections.
    <br><br>
    Users were going to be authenticated via Google Sign-In so that we would not have to deal with
    passwords. Users were to update their own phone numbers, addresses, and emergency contacts.
    Administrators would add and delete users, and assign users access to certain manuals in a private Google Sheets spreadsheet containing all users.
    <br><br>
    The manuals were to be restricted to certain users via the Google Sheets spreadsheet with yes/no columns.
    Manuals were to be private Google Docs documents.

     Note Log-out only works on "real" gmail logins.
